 PyQt5

The PyQt package is built around the Qt framework, which is a cross-platform framework used for creating a plethora of applications for various platforms. The PyQt5 package includes a detailed set of bindings for Python based on the latest version v5 of the Qt application framework.
Similar to the Qt5 framework, PyQt5 is also fully cross-platform. By leveraging the power of PyQt5, developers can build applications for platforms like Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and more.
When it comes to creating GUIs, the PyQt5 arsenal offers the impressive QtGui and the QtDesigner module, which provide numerous visual elements that the developer can implement with a simple drag and drop. Of course, the option of creating these elements by code also exists, allowing you to create both small-scale as well as large-scale applications with ease. Python’s modularity trickles down to PyQt5 in the form of extensions, giving you a lot more features than just GUI building. If you like what you see here, you can give PyQt5 a try with the command “pip install PyQt5”.


Tkinter

Often referred to as the go-to GUI toolkit by a majority of Python developers, Tkinter was created to equip modern developers with a standard interface to the Tk GUI toolkit with its Python bindings. In Tkinter’s world, most of the visual elements that we’re familiar with are called widgets, and each of these widgets offers a different level of customizability.
Tkinter comes baked into current Python installers for all major operating systems and offers a host of commonly used elements that we’re sure you must be familiar with. Some of those visual elements have been listed below:
● Frame: for providing a structure to your application
● Buttons: used for taking input from the user
● Checkbuttons: used for making selections
● Labels: for displaying textual information
● File Dialogs: for uploading or downloading files to/from the application
● Canvas: provides a space for drawing/painting things like graphs and plots


Kivy

Written with a mix of Python and Cython, Kivy is an open-source GUI framework for building some of the most intuitive user interfaces encompassing multi-touch applications that implement Natural User Interface(NUI).
A NUI is a kind of interface where the user naturally learns about the various interactions provided by a user interface while they’re usually kept invisible.
With Kivy, interface designers can code once and deploy to multiple platforms, while the built-in support for OpenGL ES 2 allows them to use modern and powerful graphics and design techniques. The most common use of the Kivy GUI framework in the real-world can be seen in our Android and iOS applications. Other widespread implementations of the framework can be seen in the user interfaces of Linux, Windows, Raspberry Pi, and Mac OS devices. You can easily add this framework to your environment by following the installation instructions provided on their website.
